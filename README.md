# Efficient-Incremental-Data-Ingestion-Pipeline

## Overview:
This project centers on developing an incremental data ingestion pipeline for analyzing credit card spending habits in India. It leverages efficient data handling techniques to ingest only new or updated records from the dataset, thus optimizing both processing time and system resource consumption. The project seamlessly integrates data retrieval from Kaggle, transformation via pandas, storage in MySQL, and optional backup to Amazon S3, making it scalable for large datasets.

## Objective:
The primary goal of this pipeline is to implement **incremental data ingestion**, ensuring that only new data is processed during each run. This method is particularly effective for handling datasets that grow over time, allowing for real-time updates without the need for complete re-ingestion, thus saving computational resources and reducing overhead.

## Core Concepts:

### 1. Incremental Ingestion Process:
- **What It Solves**: 
  - In traditional batch data processing, the entire dataset is reloaded and processed during each update, which can be resource-intensive and time-consuming. Incremental ingestion avoids this by selectively processing only new or modified data, ensuring efficient data management.

- **How It Works**: 
  - Each time the pipeline runs, it identifies and retrieves only the new data that hasn't been previously ingested. This is achieved by comparing unique fields such as transaction IDs or timestamps between the newly fetched data and the records already stored in the database.
  - The process follows a systematic approach: checking for the most recent record in the database, filtering the incoming dataset for newer records, and ingesting only those.

### 2. Kaggle API Integration:
- The project uses the Kaggle API to download the dataset, specifically focusing on **credit card spending data in India**. The dataset is periodically fetched as part of the ingestion process, ensuring the system is updated with the most recent data.
- **Data Acquisition**: The Kaggle API enables the script to download the dataset on a scheduled basis, allowing automated and continuous data updates.

### 3. Data Processing and Transformation:
- Once downloaded, the raw dataset is transformed using **pandas**. Initial processing steps include:
  - Cleaning: Handling missing values, correcting data types, and preparing the data for analysis.
  - Filtering: Only the necessary columns and records are processed, focusing on relevant metrics such as transaction amounts, spending patterns, and timestamps.

- **Transformation for Incremental Ingestion**: The core transformation step is the comparison between new data and existing data in the database. By leveraging unique fields, the pipeline ensures only new transactions are added, making the ingestion process both time-efficient and scalable.

### 4. Database Integration (MySQL with SQLAlchemy):
- The processed data is stored in a MySQL relational database using **SQLAlchemy**. This serves as the systemâ€™s persistent storage, allowing for robust querying and analysis of the ingested data.
- **Efficient Ingestion Logic**:
  - The database serves as the reference point for incremental ingestion. Each time the pipeline runs, it queries the database to find the most recent record (based on the unique identifier) and then compares it with the new data retrieved from Kaggle.
  - Only records that are newer than the last ingested entry are processed, ensuring the database remains updated without unnecessary duplication.

### 5. AWS S3 Cloud Backup (Optional):
- For added scalability and backup, the processed data can be uploaded to **Amazon S3** using **Boto3**. This allows for cloud storage of both the raw and processed datasets, ensuring redundancy and accessibility for further cloud-based processing or analysis.

## Steps Involved in the Incremental Ingestion Pipeline:

### 1. Data Retrieval:
- The script fetches the latest dataset from Kaggle using the Kaggle API. The dataset is stored locally for transformation and comparison.

### 2. Data Transformation:
- The downloaded dataset is loaded into pandas for cleaning and filtering. Unique identifiers (e.g., transaction ID, date, or timestamp) are used to prepare the data for comparison with the existing records.

### 3. Incremental Comparison:
- A query is executed on the MySQL database to retrieve the last ingested record (i.e., the latest transaction date or ID). The new dataset is filtered to include only those records that have been added since the last ingestion.
- This step prevents the reprocessing of old data, significantly improving performance and storage efficiency.

### 4. Data Ingestion:
- Only the newly identified records are ingested into the MySQL database. SQLAlchemy is used to streamline the connection and ensure the data is properly inserted with minimal overhead.
- Any duplication is prevented by checking the database before ingestion, ensuring only unique records are stored.

### 5. Optional Cloud Backup:
- Once the new data has been ingested into MySQL, it can also be uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket as part of a backup or for further cloud-based operations.

## Key Advantages of Incremental Ingestion:
- **Optimized Resource Usage**: By ingesting only new data, the system avoids wasting computational resources and reduces the need for extensive storage space.
- **Scalability**: The incremental ingestion process makes it easier to handle continuously growing datasets, as only the most recent entries are processed.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Less storage and processing time translates into reduced operational costs, making it ideal for large-scale data ingestion workflows.

## Technologies and Libraries:
- **Pandas & Numpy**: For efficient data manipulation, cleaning, and transformation.
- **MySQL & SQLAlchemy**: For relational database management, with SQLAlchemy simplifying database connection and query execution.
- **Kaggle API**: Used to retrieve the dataset in a programmatic and automated manner.
- **Boto3**: AWS SDK for uploading data to S3, facilitating cloud backup and storage.
- **TQDM**: For progress tracking during data loading and ingestion.

## Conclusion:
The incremental ingestion pipeline ensures that only new data is ingested, optimizing both time and resources. This project demonstrates how to efficiently process large, continuously updated datasets by integrating data from external sources like Kaggle, transforming it using pandas, storing it in MySQL for analysis, and optionally backing it up in the cloud. This pipeline can be adapted to various industries and data sources, making it a scalable and flexible solution for data-driven workflows.
